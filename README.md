# Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project performed on the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The goal of this project is to analyze passenger data, clean and preprocess it, visualize key relationships, and extract meaningful insights about survival patterns.
